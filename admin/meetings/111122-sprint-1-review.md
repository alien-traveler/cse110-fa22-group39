# Reviewing the goal for the sprint
The goal is to check the overall progress on this project.

# Demonstrating new features implemented
Since this is the first week of actual coding, we are still preparing more features and designing the structure of the project. By the end of this week, we have accomplished most of the frontend work such as building pages with HTML and CSS and most of the Javascript files for each page. Mingyi, as the lead of the  frontend, and Jacky, as the lead of the backend, have demonstrated and explained their latest work. 

A demo of pages can be found [here by figma (version 2)](https://www.figma.com/file/mACNR0meaqsqXqtvanpEsK/Prototype-1-Cafe?node-id=0%3A1)

Some screenshots of the current pages are here:
